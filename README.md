To run the webpage you only need to run the appV2.py file and it will dedicate you an IP adress.


In the Ubuntu Server I have the following commands to find, kill and reboot.


Find running tasks:
ps -ef | grep app

Kill process:
kill -9 #numberofprocess

Enter folder:
cd Q

Start webpage:
nohup python3.7 appV2.py &

Everything is working now...
